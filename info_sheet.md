**Welcome Page Instructions**

Welcome

We invite you to take part in this research study, which aims to understand _ **&quot;mood, emotion, and attention&quot; among youth** _. The study is conducted by _Nidhi Sinha_ (PhD- Psychology, IIT Hyderabad) under the supervision of _Dr. Priyanka Srivastava_ (PI, PAC Group, IIIT, Hyderabad). If you would like further information regarding any aspect of this study, you are encouraged to contact the researchers at the details provided at the end of this information sheet.

**Who can participate and what does this research involve?**

Anyone aged 18-27, and currently enrolled in a university or college is eligible to participate. This research involves three tasks in total: emotion task, attention network task, and mood profiling task, and thus the project is called **TEAM Profiling Project** (_Task for Emotion, Attention, and Mood Profiling_). The **Emotion task** measures how you feel while viewing an image. The **Attention network task** measures how you both attend and ignore the information, and finally the **mood profiling task** taps on your mood and emotion for a given period of time through self reporting measures.

There will be some demographic questions as well at the beginning of the study.

Remember, there is no **right or wrong answer.** Try to answer as honestly and truthfully as possible.

This study will take around 45-50 mins to complete. While you will be given enough breaks in between, you may take breaks in between as well if you feel like resting.

Note:

Kindly use Chrome or Firefox to complete this experiment.

DO NOT USE INTERNET EXPLORER!

**Are there any benefits or risks?**

Your participation in this experiment will be immensely helpful in understanding how youth perceive and attend to information around them. The finding of this research would be further instrumental in designing interfaces to help individuals having difficulties with their mood, attention or emotions.

There are no associated physical or psychological harm associated with participation in this study.

**How will my data be used and protected?**

Your participation in this research is entirely voluntary and anonymous. Your data will be stored with a unique anonymous User ID. The data will be accessible only to those working on the project.

**Emotion Task Instructions**

**EMOTION**

You will now be presented with a series of images. For each image, your task is to view the image and make an **emotional judgment** of how the image made you feel. You are required to report your feeling on two scales from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;9&quot;:

1. The first scale covers the _ **feeling of pleasure** _, ranging from _ **extremely unpleasant to extremely pleasant feeling.** _ The feeling &quot;pleasant&quot; refers to the feeling of being pleased, satisfied, elated, hopeful, contented, happy, fun, or relaxed. Whereas, the feeling &quot;unpleasant&quot; refers to the feeling of unhappy, despair, unsatisfied, melancholic, annoyed, hopeless or sad

If you feel extremely unpleasant, choose 1, and choose 9 for an extremely pleasant feeling. You can choose &quot;5&quot; in case you neither feel pleasant nor feel unpleasant,

2. The second scale covers the _ **state of arousal** _, ranging from _ **sleepy to aroused** _.

The state of &quot;sleepy&quot; means a state of low excitement, dullness, boredom, or idleness. Whereas, the &quot;aroused&quot; state indicates the state of being wide-awake, stimulated, or highly excited.

If you feel sleepy, choose 1, and choose 9 for an aroused state. If you neither feel sleepy or aroused, you can choose &quot;5.&quot;

![](RackMultipart20201005-4-yp3w4x_html_9b5bed5e7e23f496.png)

There is **no right or wrong** response. Select &quot;a point&quot; on the scale that best describes your feeling of pleasure and state of excitement as labeled.

This task will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete this task.

**ANT instructions**

**First Page:**

This task will test how you attend to information to make a decision.

On each trial, you will be shown **five pickup trucks** on the screen pointing either to the left or to the right.

For example they could be one of the following:

\&lt;Insert Target Images here\&gt;

You are required only to respond to the direction of the **CENTRAL TRUCK**.

You should press the

LEFT SHIFT KEY if the **CENTRAL** truck points to the LEFT

RIGHT SHIFT KEY if the **CENTRAL** truck points to the RIGHT

Press the SPACEBAR key to continue

**Second Page:**

The five trucks might all look in the same direction or they might look in the different directions.

Your task is to determine the _ **direction** _ of the truck in the **CENTER.**

\&lt;Insert the direction of the target trial\&gt;

Before the trucks appear, you will see a **+** at the center of the screen. Make sure that you are looking at the + all the time.

The truck will either appear at the TOP of the screen or at the BOTTOM of the screen.

\&lt;Insert the direction of the a single target trial/ Top\&gt;

Or

\&lt;Insert the direction of the a single target trial/ Down\&gt;

Press the SPACEBAR key to continue

**Third Page:**

Sometimes you might also see a \* .

The \* will let you know that the trucks will appear soon.

If you see the \* to the top or to the bottom of +, you will know WHERE the trucks will appear.

\&lt;Insert the spatial condition cue here\&gt;

If you see two \* at the top or the bottom, you will not know WHERE the truck will appear.

\&lt;Insert the double condition cue here\&gt;

If you see no or one \* in the middle, you will NOT know WHERE the truck will appear .

\&lt;Insert the center condition cue here\&gt;

Remember, your task is to respond to the direction of the CENTER truck. So make sure you press the key that matches where the CENTER truck is pointing.

When the truck appears, try to press the corresponding key that matches the direction of the center truck as quickly as possible as you can, but not so fast that you will make any mistake.

For the practice block, you will receive feedback for your response. However, no feedback will be provided for the test trials.

**Final Page:**

Kindly make sure that you are seated at a distance of 65 cm from the screen of your laptop or computer.

Press the SPACEBAR Key if you are ready to begin the practice session.

After the practice block, this message will appear.

This is the end of the practice block. Press any key to begin with the experiment.

After each block these messages will appear.

Take a short break. Hit any key to resume the experiment.

Instructions for ANT ( Fan et al)

This is an experiment investigating attention. You will be shown an arrow on the screen pointing either to the left or to the right (for example -\&gt; or \&lt;- ). On some trials, the arrow will be flanked by two arrows to the left and two arrows to the right (for example -\&gt;-\&gt;-\&gt;-\&gt;-\&gt; or -\&gt;-\&gt;\&lt;--\&gt;-\&gt;). Your task is to respond to the direction of the CENTRAL arrow. You should press the left mouse button with your left thumb if the central arrow points to the left or press the right mouse button with your right thumb if the central arrow points to the right.

Please make your response as quickly and accurately as possible. Your reaction time and accuracy will be recorded.

There will be a cross (&quot;+&quot;) in the center of the screen and the arrows will appear either above or below the cross. You should try to fixate on the cross throughout the experiment.

On some trials there will be asterisk cues indicating when or where the arrow will occur. If the cue is at the center or both above and below fixation it indicates that the arrow will appear shortly. If the cue is only above or below fixation it indicates both that the trial will occur shortly and where it will occur. Try to maintain fixation at all times. However, you may attend when and where indicated by the cues.

The experiment contains four blocks. The first block is for practice and takes about two minutes. The other three blocks are experimental blocks and each takes about five minutes. After each block there will be a message &quot;take a break&quot; and you may take a short rest. After it, you can press the space bar to begin the next block. The whole experiment takes about twenty minutes.

If you have any question, please ask the experimenter.

Press SPACE bar to start the practice trials.

Previous Version of Instructions (Nidhi)

In this task, you will be shown a set of five pickup trucks, where you will be asked to determine the _ **direction of the center pickup truck** _.

If it is pointing to the left, press….key . If it is pointing to the right, press… key.

The heads of the neighbouring pickup trucks will be either in the same direction, the opposite direction, or will be absent. You are required to ignore the neighbouring pickup trucks, and respond only to the central pickup truck. Some examples are shown below.

In addition, the pickup truck stimuli will either occur slightly above the center or slightly below the center of the screen. Prior to each stimuli a \* symbol will appear sometimes to cue you regarding the possible location of the new target. If a single \* appears above or below the center of the screen, the stimulus will always appear in that location. Other times the cue will happen in the center, or two cues will happen (one on the top and one one on the bottom) or no cue will occur. In this case, you will not know whether the target stimuli will be on the top or bottom. Press any key to see the sequence of the stimuli.

You will now start a short block of practice trials. After each trial, you will get feedback whether you are correct or not. Note that there will be no feedback for the experimental trial. Try to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Remember to use … key if the center pickup truck is pointing to the right, and … key if the center pickup truck is pointing to the left.

Press any key to begin.
